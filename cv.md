### About:
I've started learning programming and web-development by watching tutorials and reading information on the web as a hobby.  
But eventually I realised that it would be great to try myself in real commercial projects.  
So I deepend my knowledge and applied for a job in a local web-studio.  
Now I work as a web-developer and continue to dive deeper in various it-technologies and try to keep up with modern standarts of web-dev.

My goal is to become a proficient programmer. I'm interested in both frondend and backend.  
I realy enjoy my occupation, because there is always something new to learn:slightly_smiling_face:

Besides programming, I enjoy travelling, reading books and playing guitar:guitar:
